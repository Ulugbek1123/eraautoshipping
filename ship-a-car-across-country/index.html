						<h2>What Is Cross-Country Car Shipping?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Cross-country car shipping is when you ship a car across the country from one end to another. You can ship a car cross-country from north to south, east to west, or on any other auto shipping route that spans a large chunk of the country. Cross-country car transport usually spans 2,000 miles or more from east to west, and 1,300 to 1,500 miles or so from north to south.</p>
						<p>Other shorter car shipping routes might be considered “cross-country,” though, depending on the placement of the car pickup and delivery locations. You can move a car across the country on your own, rent a trailer hitch, or secure other self-shipping equipment for the job. Professional cross-country car shipping services vary greatly in price depending on the car transport company you contract through. Some movers and travelers prefer DIY cross-country car transport because of the lower out-the-door costs.</p>

							<p dir="ltr">Recently I did a cross country trip from Los Angeles to Washington DC. I called to inquire about a quote and it ranged in price depending on how I wanted my car transported. There were 3 different options varying from fastest transport time to transporting in an actual truck that protects the exterior. I chose the middle option as I wasn’t in a rush to get my vehicle and it was the best option for me financially.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Nexus took the deposit which was only a couple hundred dollars and sent me a verification email of services. They connected me to the actual driver who was super professional and communicated with me really well at the time of pickup. He let me know when I’d get my vehicle in DC and said he’d connect with me 24 hours prior to schedule a pickup time. I would highly recommend them and if I ever do a long distance move in the future I would call them again.<br /></p>

				<h2>What Is the Cheapest Way to Ship a Car Across the Country?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="text-img mb-0">
				<div class="text-content full">
					<div class="text">
						<p>The cheapest way to ship your car is
							<strong>via an open car hauler</strong>. Typically, an open auto transporter holds up to ten vehicles at a time. This extended capacity lets operators save on transportation, oil, and fuel costs when providing cross-country car shipping services. Those savings are passed on to you when shipping a car across the United States!
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Open auto transport with terminal-to-terminal delivery</strong>
							is the cheapest way to transport your car at any time of year. You’ll have to factor in the added costs of traveling to both terminals, though, and driving your car to and from both sites. And, with storage fees factored in, door-to-door car shipping service might be the cheaper choice.
						</p>
						<p>Be sure to look for
							<strong>potential car transport
							</strong>discounts when researching professional vehicle transportation. For example, at Nexus Auto Transport, we offer a military discount to show our gratitude to those who serve our country.
						</p>
						<p>Also, the distance you ship your car increases, the cost per mile of transport decreases. Therefore,
							<strong>shipping your car a longer distance might end up saving you money!
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>When time is of the essence, expedited car shipping is an option. However,
							<strong>a quicker car delivery turnaround comes with a bigger price tag</strong>. It’s not the cheapest way to transport your car, so make sure you organize your shipment as soon as possible.

						<h2>Is Cross-Country Car Shipping Door-to-Door?
						</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>There are two types of cross-country car shipping -- door-to-door car transport and terminal-to-terminal car shipping. We recommend door-to-door vehicle transport because it’s easier and quicker than terminal-to-terminal shipping. You don’t have to drive to the nearest terminal to pick up your car and then coordinate another driver to bring it back. And at Nexus Auto Transport, door-to-door vehicle transport is comparable in cost to terminal-to-terminal transport from other providers!</p>

						<h2>When Do We Recommend Cross-Country Car Transport?

Our car shipping cost calculator will provide you with affordable vehicle shipping rates within seconds! No matter the reason for shipping a car, hiring the best auto transport company to ship your car is the most sensible option.</p>
						<p>And if you’re worried about the overall cost to ship a car, Nexus can help. Auto shipping costs are difficult to calculate on your own.

				<h2>How Do Seasons Affect the Cost of My Shipment?</h2>

								<div class="card-body">
									<div class="season-texts">
										<p>If you’re shipping your car in the winter, you can expect the shipment time to take longer than in other seasons. This is because there is less daylight and ice and snow can cause delays.</p>
										<p>In December, many transport drivers are taking time off for the holidays. So you want to book around one month in advance to make sure that your car gets a spot.</p>
										<p>January is a very popular time for car shipments because everyone is going south for this winter. Rates can increase and a backlog might occur. February is a fairly slow month for car shipment bookings, however, and rates here may be at their cheapest.</p>

You might expect rates to be very high during this time. Yet demand, as well as the competition, is so strong that prices may go down.</p>
										<p>Throughout the summer months, the price to ship a car is more or less stable.</p>

				<h2>What Factors Affect the Cost of My Shipment?</h2>
				<span>When you're looking to ship your car across the country, there are certain decisions that you can make that will affect your total auto shipping cost. Let's look at those factors below.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="text-img reversed">
				<div class="text-content">
					<div class="text">
						<h4>Distance and Delivery time</h4>
						<p>The longer it takes to move your car from one location to another, the more it will end up costing you. Generally, it takes between 5-14 days to ship from the West Coast to the East Coast. It also takes 3-8 days to ship from the Midwest to either the West Coast or the East Coast. And it takes about 3-8 days to ship your car from the North to the South.</p>
						<h4>Type of car transport truck</h4>
						<p>An open car transport truck is cheaper than enclosed car transport. Of course, this method exposes your car to possible damage from weather and debris but these risks are fairly low. An enclosed transport truck is recommended for highly valuable cars. Because these car hauling trucks can't hold as many cars, they make up for the lost revenue by charging more for their services.</p>

						<h2>What is the Cheapest Way to Ship Your Car?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>Open auto transport with terminal-to-terminal delivery is often the cheapest way to transport your car. Typically, an open auto transporter can hold up to ten cars. This lets operators save on transportation, oil, and fuel costs.
						</p>
						<p>However, if there are storage fees, then door-to-door service might be cheaper than terminal-to-terminal shipping. If you want to save even more money, try to ship your car during the cheaper seasons listed above.

					<p>Most auto transport companies accept all forms of payment. These include credit and debit cards, checks, and cash. However, some companies will charge you a fee if you pay with a card. Make sure you ask the company what payment methods they accept. Also, ask if they'll charge you extra for the way that you choose to pay.</p>
					<p>Many auto transport companies will charge you a deposit fee before they pick up your car. That fee will be applied to your total when the car is delivered. Most carriers offer a 100% refundable deposit.</p>

						<h2>Why is it Important to Know How Much it Costs to Ship a Car?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="text">
						<p>While shipping a car across the country may seem costly at first, it's not. If you drive your car cross-country, the hidden costs of gas, lodging, and future car repairs will add up. The cost to ship a car across the country by yourself is much higher than most people expect!</p>
						<p>By learning how much it costs to ship a car across the country, you can make more informed and confident purchasing decisions. And in our industry (and any industry for that matter), consumers who do their homework are the ones who save money on their overall cross-country car shipping cost.</p>

Next, you need to arrange shipping services via boat or air to its destination country.
